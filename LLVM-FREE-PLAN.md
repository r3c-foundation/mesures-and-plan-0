# ⚙️ Post-LLVM Adaptation Plan

## Objective
Ensure R3C remains compatible regardless of Rust backend evolution.

## Action Items
- [ ] Maintain backend isolation under `r3c_backend/`
- [ ] Prepare stubs for `backend_cranelift/` and `backend_gccrs/`
- [ ] Add CI watcher for Rust compiler version updates
- [ ] Update README once Rust 4.x introduces non-LLVM backends

## Strategic Position
Even if Rust detaches from LLVM,  
R3C stays valuable as a **C++ → Rust → ASM bridge** and a **historic reference of LLVM-free design**.
